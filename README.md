# InProj

My program, permit the registration of new user only by Super Amin of my program with his credentials (Username and Password). He is, also, the one who determine the role of every registered user  and these roles are:  permission to view only his messages, permission to view and edit his messages and permission to view, edit and delete which message he wants. In my program, I have not include the creation of a simple user, because I assume that a simple user can be a user with the first role.
The admin has the permission of editing, deleting personal info of registered users. He has the permission of sending, editing and deleting messages from the database of my program. 
When a user is logged in, he can see the messages that he has received from the other users.
At the end, I create 3 different text files, one for the sent messages, one for the edited messages and one for the deleted.
